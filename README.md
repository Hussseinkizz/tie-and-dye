## Tie & Dye Version 1.5.5, 9 Dec 2020 Setup

Tie & Dye is a set of CSS libraries and codepen utilised together to bring all the mind blowing CSS tricks into your designs.

### For Basic Usage & More Info Goto:
[Tie & Dye Documentation Here](https://tie-and-dye.github.io)

However we recommend that you use Tie & Dye as a whole instead of partials, otherwise if you're using any other CSS preset or framework you have to use partials, see our docs on the right procedure of using those partials.


### â˜‘ Dependency Libraries:
As per this version, you have to import the dependency libraries manually into your HTML, using the steps described in our installation docs.
